## Features
### Directory Structure
This project is mainly based on [bulletproof react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/tree/master/apps/react-vite). 

A `features` directory is created to separate concerns by functionality, which improves code organisation and maintainability.

I usually adopt this structure because
- By organising code according to concerns, the codebase stays manageable and won't be overly complex.
- It makes adding or deleting features easy, and when a destructive change occurs, it helps minimise its impact on the application.

### Biome
[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)

As a code formatting tool, I used Biome instead of ESLint and Prettier.
Compare to ESlint, Biome has a much simpler configuration.  To speed up the development I adopted Biome and I believe that it's more suitable for small projects.

### UI Library (shadcn/ui)
To build a polished and accessible application quickly, this project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

This library is built on Tailwind CSS and provides a wide range of commonly used UI components essential for building modern web applications.

Since it generates components directly into the project directory, we donâ€™t need to worry about library updates, and customisation is easy both in terms of appearance and functionality.
